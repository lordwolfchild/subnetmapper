SubnetMapper
============

SubnetMapper is an admins quick tool to map and keep track of his managed ip networks, free ranges that are available for assigning and documenting his network setup.

It has been designed to help the admin to manage and document small to medium networks. SubnetMapper prints and displays neat little maps of your network, freely colourable, in the way some of you may remember from school or neat little cisco courses.

SubnetMapper is free software, available under the GPLv2. Feel free to spread, manipulate etc., but always credit me. IF you do something to my code let me know, I would be happy to improve the official SubnetMapper Version with your help (granting you full credit of course).

It was originally designed to run on Mac OS X (https://www.wolfchild.de/software/subnetmapper.html). The whole program will be ported to Qt. The first release will feature beginning IPv6 Support.
