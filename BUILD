SubnetMapper is a Qt5 Project. It has no other dependencies than Qt5. It
uses the Qt5 xml, network, svg and printsupport modules.

To build it should suffice to maintan a standard Qt5 build environment, which
includes qmake. Run "qmake", followed by "make all" to build the binary.

Additionally, Qt Creator can be used to build SubnetMapper. Just load the project
file in the ide and build the binary using a Qt5 toolkit.
